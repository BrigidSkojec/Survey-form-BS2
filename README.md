# Survey-form-BS2
Objective:
Your task is to design and build a survey form about a topic you're passionate about. For now, you'll focus primarily on content, clear HTML markup, and logical structure rather than advanced visual styling. Use Figma to create a simple layout first, then replicate it in HTML.
